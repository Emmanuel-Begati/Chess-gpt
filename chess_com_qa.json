As a result I think I expend too much brain power throughout the game and get burned out or overwhelmed by the possibilites, for example in the opening I would try consider all my opponents responses of which there are many in the opening, sometimes I feel habits such as these are unnecessary and are just a waste of energy.

        "question": "Chess study methods / memorisation techniques from before the computer-based SRS era",
        "answer": "Some of the other questions on SE discuss the use of spaced repetition systems such as Anki and Mnemosyne to learn tactics, openings and other aspects of chess (see especiallyEffectiveness of a spaced repetition system (SRS) for memorizing tactical patterns for long-term skill gain?). \n(I am also aware that memorisation should never be done at the cost of understanding (seeUnderstanding vs. Memorization).My question, however, is about older memorisation techniques that don't rely on current SRS software. So far, I have found only one example of spaced repetition that does not rely on a computer. It comes from Hans Bouwmeester's bookSchaken als vak: brug naar het professionele schaak(1976; English:Chess as a profession: bridge towards professional chess). (Bouwmeester coached people likeJan Timman,Gert LigterinkandPaul van der Sterren.)At the end of a chapter about building up a card index or filing system for opening theory, he briefly describes a method for memorising opening variations (pp. 96-97). Assuming that you can subdivide your opening repertoire into 16 groups, you can review it in the following way (with 1.5 to 2 hours of study per day):Day  1:     1\nDay  2:     2   1\nDay  3:     3   2\nDay  4:     4   3   1\nDay  5:     5   4   2\nDay  6:     6   5   3\nDay  7:     7   6   4\nDay  8:     8   7   5   1\nDay  9:     9   8   6   2\nDay 10:     10  9   7   3\nDay 11:     11  10  8   4\nDay 12:     12  11  9   5\nDay 13:     13  12  10  6\nDay 14:     14  13  11  7\nDay 15:     15  14  12  8\nDay 16:     16  15  13  9   1\nDay 17:     1   16  14  10  2\nDay 18:     2   1   15  11  3\nDay 19:     3   2   16  12  4\nDay 20:     4   3   1   13  5\nDay 21:     5   4   2   14  6\nDay 22:     6   5   3   15  7\nDay 23:     7   6   4   16  8So, every day, you take a \"new\" group, you review the group from the day before, the group from 3 days earlier, the group from 1 week earlier and the group that was new 15 days earlier.Bouwmeester implies that there are other methods, but he does not mention any. Is anybody aware of other methods (possibly from other chess books)? Have Dvoretsky, Jusupov or Aagaard written anything about this in their books?"

        "answer": "Recently I found the gameTal vs. Byrne (1976), that opens withChekhover Variation of the Sicilian Defense. What got my attention in this variation was move7, for, just like Tal did, every engine says that the best move is7. Nc3, but for some reason I like how7. Ng5looks:[FEN \"\"]\n1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Qxd4 Nc6 5. Bb5 Bd7 6. Bxc6 Bxc6 7. Ng5!? (7. Ng5 e5 8. Qc4 Qd7)Stockfish 6 says it is slightly better for black (-0.8 at depth=22 to be precise), but the main idea is simply to explore the weakness of the f7 pawn. The main line I was thinking was7... e5 8. Qc4, the natural urge to punish the white queen at the center creates the threat of mate on f7, so black is somewhat obligated to lift the queen to the 7th rank. Anyway, if this \"trick\" fails, for example after8... Qd7, there is no immediate advantage for white, and it seems that the only difference from Tal's 1976 variation is that here white is behind in development (and ready to be punished!).I couldn't find any game with the move7. Ng5in chessgames.com, but I still think that it is a natural looking move that seems to have a possible tactic behind it, even if I wasn't able to find. So my question is:Is7. Ng5reallyonlya bad move? The downside is that obvious? Or there is a possible tactic behind it? (besides the threat of mate on f7 after7... e5 8. Qc4)"

I play only on weekends. I have computer eyestrain too (a different case, not OTB chess eyestrain). But on weekends I still get eyestrain even when playing OTB only and not using a computer.

        "question": "Winning position after move one?",
        "answer": "Question:There are 400 possible two-ply openings; that is, positions that can arise after each player has made one move.  Which of these positions, if any, are winning (either for white or for black) with perfect play?Context:It's very likely that chess is a draw with perfect play, which would mean that there is no one-ply opening that gives white a winning position.This questionasks about theworstfirst move for white; if there is any first move so bad that black is winning with correct play, then that move (combined with black's best response) would of course be an answer to this question.On the other hand, there definitely are some three-ply openings where black is winning; for example, black has mate in one after 1. f3 e5 2. g4.My attempts:I ran Stockfish 15 on a handful of two-ply openings that seemed most likely to be winning for white, along with the two one-ply openings that seem worst for white.  The most promising lines I found were as follows (along with the depth and number of meganodes in my searches, plus the best continuation and comments on transpositions):d4 g5:  +2.95 (depth 55/68, 55298 MN; 2.

Instead, what I'm looking for is reasonable evidence one way or the other, for all of the most unequal two-ply openings.  For example, if white wins 90 times out of 100 when a strong engine plays itself (or when multiple strong engines play each other) from a given position, then I would regard that as strong evidence that the position is a win for white with perfect play.PSsince I know someone will say it otherwise:  this is a theoretical question, and I'm not interested in \"loophole\" answers like resigning or letting your clock run out."

However, as I play at random times I find myself playing in different settings:With a mouseWith an Ipad (touchscreen)With a smartphone (touchscreen)What surprised me is that the mouse does not significantly outperform the alternatives.Though I am struggling to analyze this numerically, I feel that the mouse is by far best when making planned moves (especially something like a4-a5-a6-a7 or Ra1-Ra2-Ra1-Ra2...) where the smartphone is faster for making unexpected/semi expected moves (typically allowing me to build up pressure in the midgame where I kind-of know what kind of moves to make but cannot commit to an exact order in advance).Now my question:Are there any evaluations on touch vs mouse speed/accuracy for 'normal people' done beyond the scale of an individual? Especially for different kind of moves?This is more a question of curiosity, but perhaps there could be practical applications. For instance, if the results are conclusive I might get some of the top players to test using a touchscreen instead, or if the switching is not to bad this could even be done for just the midgame.What have I tried:As mentioned I tried it myselfI searched online, found plenty of individuals who say one option or the other is better. Also found several statements specifically about the mouse being faster in a pre-move setting.I checked what (top) players do in chess and other games. Most of them use a mouse, however this may simply be because they cannot afford to be slower at expected moves/pre-moves.I am still thinking on how to investigate this myself. Of course chess based analysis would be the best, but perhaps it is sufficient to tap into more general research on device control."

Prior to this commit, a drawn position was assigned a score of zero; afterwards, it is randomly assigned a score of +/-1 (that is, a tiny non-zero value). In the commit message, the intended result is explained:The effect is that in positions with many 3fold draw lines, different\n  lines are followed at each iteration. This keeps the search much more dynamic,\n  as opposed to being locked to one particular 3fold.An example of a position where master suffers from 3fold-blindness and this patch\n  solves quickly is the famous TCEC game 53:FEN: 3r2k1/pr6/1p3q1p/5R2/3P3p/8/5RP1/3Q2K1 b - - 0 51master doesn't see that this is a lost position (draw eval up to depth 50) as\n  Qf6-e6 d4-d5 (found by patch at depth 23) leads to a loss.I don't understand what the change actually accomplishes.

Kd2? Nd4 2. Bxd4 exd4 3. b4 Ke5 4. Kd3 h5! 5. g3 h4Nunn writes,and [Black] is just in time to prevent h4 by White. Now White cannot make progress and the game is drawn.Using computer analysis, I see that the move 6. Kc4 loses in the resulting position, due to 6... hxg3 7. hxg3 g4! So white's best attempt is not Kc4 but rather playing f4 at the right time.Why is it advantageous for each side to occupy h4? I have some thoughts on the matter but would appreciate a more complete answer.Thoughts:If white occupies h4, he can exchange hxg5 hxg5 at the right time and liquidate the kingside, so that black can't queen with an h-pawn. This is especially important since white's plan is to push f4, capture the d4 pawn and then attack on the queenside. Better not to leave behind a black h-pawn that can queen.If black occupies h4, then he has an advanced h-pawn that can\npotentially queen, especially if white tries to break through with\nf4. (In the case of f4, black can counterattack on the kingside.)Compare the above (drawn) position with the position below which is won for white. The moves are given by Stockfish. I think this illustrates why exchanging h-pawns is advantageous for white, so that he can attack on the queenside more freely.8/2p2p2/7p/4k1p1/1P1pP2P/3K1PP1/8/8 w - - 0 1\n\n1. hxg5 hxg5 2. b5 f6 3. f4+ Ke6 4.

        "answer": "I was looking at Fritz Online (https://fritz.chessbase.com/) engine's parameters/performance. Here is screen relating to one of made moves.It means that there was a general depth equals to 15 but some branches were even explored to depth 39. Engine was analysing at average speed 530k positions per second. It lasted 5 sec. so ~2.6M nodes were evaluated.Let's consider branching factor 3 at each level. Then there are 3^15=14M leaves to evaluate (not taking into account internal nodes). As we see in case of branching factor 3 we have more nodes to analyze (14M) than it really took place (2.6M) (not even considering branches explored deeper than 15).Branching factor in chess is aproximately 35. I'm aware there are many, many sophisticated techniques to prune branches in search tree. But really from 35 to less than 3? How it's possible that more than 90% of branches are pruned?Two remarks:Provided parameters/performance come from phase between opening and middlegame. This is NOT taken from ending where branching factor is significantly lower.Depth 15 is not something unusual.

I prefer to present it as a practical endgame position worth having a look at.Therefore I won't even give a specific statement : white to play, and it's up to you to figure out if they can win or only draw. I must warn you it's rather difficult to analyse this position accurately. There is one concealed idea (and programs won't be able to help much figuring it out).  But I'm sure you'll feel pretty happy once you manage to figure it all out - if you do (but with brillant chess composers like Noam Elkies around, I'm sure some of you will manage to)."

Suppose this position occurred in a blitz game where Black barely has few seconds remaining on his clock. Black decides to give up the f5-pawn and instead sit comfortably with his pawns on f6 and h6 as follows-[fen \"8/5p2/6kp/p4p2/2B5/1P2PK1P/8/4b3 w - - 0 1\"]\n\n   1. Kf4 f6. 2. Bd3 Bb4. 3. Bxf5+ Kg7.This position is an impenetrable fortress. Because of the presence of bishops of opposite color, there is no way White can check the Black king or even try to win a pawn by attacking it. If White marches up the e-pawn, Black can simply capture. There is no way White can win. Black simply has to keep moving his bishop safely on the a5-e1 diagonal.Now, since this is a blitz game and Black just has a few seconds left, White simply attempts to run Black out of time just by making legal moves without making any kind of progress. In such a scenario, would Black be allowed to pause the clock and claim a draw?"

Law 6.9 of the FIDE Laws of Chess states that: \"If a\nplayer does not complete the prescribed number of moves in the\nallotted time, the game is lost by the player. However, the game is\ndrawn if the position is such that the opponent cannot checkmate the\nplayer's king by any possible series of legal moves, even with the\nmost unskilled counterplay.\" For example, a player who runs out of\ntime with a sole king versus king and bishop does not lose the game.\nIt is still possible to lose on time in positions where mate is\nextremely unlikely but not theoretically impossible, as with king and\nbishop versus king and knight. (Under USCF rules, king and bishop,\nking and knight, or king and 2 knights with no pawns on the board is\nnot considered sufficient mating material, unless the opponent has a\nforced win, even though it is theoretically possible to mate (but\nextremely unlikely to happen) in situations such as K+B vs. K+N).this is no immediate draw.The opponent keeps running away until I am out of time and lose the game.A sample game can be seenhere(I blundered on move 60 here, I could have got his knight but I pre-moved everything because I had around 5 seconds time left).

I mean when you have many games to be played, you'll lose concentration (at least I do) so isn't it better to play live tournaments (15 or 30 min for each player) isn't that a better way to concentrate on the moves?"

This happened in the above game I played as black onchess.com.I am aware that I made plenty of mistakes before and after the move, but those I understand. I am rated 1200.I discounted the rook exchange 15... Rxd1. After the game, the engine told me I would have had a +3.2 advantage if I had made the exchange. I can't work out why it creates that advantage.I considered the exchange, but I thought I would stay disciplined and principled. I remembered GM Smirnov's rule \"to take is a mistake. I have been reading in IM Silman's '\"The Amateur Mind.\" It teaches that a simple one-move capture, attack, or check is pointless if it can be easily parried.My thinking was that exchanging rooks MIGHT be useful if I gained a tempo by sending my opponent's knight to the back rank. But I saw when that they could just recapture with their queen and take control of the d file. It didn't seem that I had anything to gain. As such, I just continued to develop my pieces.Can anyone explain why this was such a critical move, and the thought processes I could have used to identify it?"

Bf4However, I have been reviewing my games, and almost every game I play I find that the engine considers my 3. Bf4 move to be either an inaccuracy or just a 'good' move. I am quite confused as to why this would not be one of the best moves - much less an inaccuracy. Consider openings I've used in 2 of the games I played: (I am white in both)1st game:\n1. d4 f6 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. Bf4 e62nd game:\n1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 c6 3. Bf4 Nf6Now, in the first game I can understand that maybe it would have been better to play pawn d5 as the computer recommends, attacking his knight. However, wouldn't this be relatively easily countered by Nb4? Of course, I could go e4, but wouldn't this just make it harder for me to defend all these pawns in the future? I prefer playing safely and if it means giving up some control over the center to ensure a middle game I am in more control of, I will take it. Could anyone explain to me why this is considered an inaccuracy by engines and perhaps offer a continuation?In the second game, I am also somewhat confused as to why the computer considers this an 'ok' move and put me from a +0.55 score to a +0.33. I'm pretty sure this is a relatively big drop in the opening... I play the move in order to create threats on the bishop's diagonal, which I have found to help quite a lot in the past. I also play the move in order to get as much control over e5 as I can, which I usually find is a key square when playing my opening (I believe it is the Chigorin opening until my bishop move). Could anyone explain to me why the computer doesn't consider this a good tactic and what other, better move I could play that would lead to an endgame that is more in my favor?I'm interested in improving my opening - thanks to whoever reads this."

        "answer": "Sometimes against Sicilian Najdorf (or french) defense I play like this:[FEN \"\"]\n\n1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 e5 7. Nf5 Bxf5 8. exf5 d5 9. Bg5 d4 10. Ne4 Be7My plan in this opening is somehow playing like Yugoslav attack, specially by opening an open line in queen side and pushing pawns into the king side of black and going for O-O-O, but I usually fail against players with rating in my range in normal game but usually I win against player with similar rating to me in blitz game by use of this handmade opening.Question:Is there a name for this opening? Is it a very weak opening? and more important than this, if I don't want to play passive against e5 in different variation of Sicilian (e.g, when my knight is at d4) what should I do?P.S: Maybe Be3 seems to be silly, but my intention is motivating to pushing e5 (by black), to use open line of f7 by my white bishop later in the game. Many players are thinking about possible fork pawn, or they see weakness in my move and they do e5."

        "question": "It is important to play e4 or d4 to 'control the center'. Myth or reality?",
        "answer": "Well, there are two premises in the question itself: 1) That e4 or d4 'controls the center'. 2) That 'Controlling the center'is something important. It appears to me that 'controlling the center' is the least of the benefits of a move  like e4 or d4. The fact is that it becomes mandatory to play e4 or d4 if you want to develop both bishops along their long diagonals(c1-h6 diagonal or a6-f1 diagonal). This seems to be the most important benefit of e4/d4 IMO and not 'controlling the center'. So while it may turn out that 1) e4 and 1) d4 give rise to good games for white I feel it may be more due to the rapid development which these moves allow rather than because these pawns 'control the center'. Indeed, sometimes, these pawns can be an obstacle for white's own pieces.(I am looking at things from white's perspective but the same argument can be similarly posed from the black player's perspective as well.). Do post your thoughts on this."

        "question": "Is there such a thing as a criterion-based diploma or certification in chess skills?",
        "answer": "The vast majority of chess titles today are fundamentallycompetitive. To be a \"master\" of any kind according to bodies like FIDE is defined in terms of being able tobeat othersrather than mastering a specified body of chess knowledge, theory, or skills. In educational theory, such chess titles arenorm-based rather than criterion-based.A recentquestionestablishes that there are criterion-basedcurriculathat an aspiring chess player may self-study, but it appears that none of them lead to any sort of recognized title, certification, degree, or other formal designation.Are there criterion-based titles or other designations in the world of chess? For example, is there a \"GED\" type qualification that doesn't represent any particular competitive rating but represents basic competency in all of the basic techniques of chess? Are there specialty skill certifications, e.g. for openings or skewers, that are obtained by passing skills tests rather than by obtaining a specified tournament rating?I'm mentally comparing this somewhat to martial arts, which typically award color belts based on passing tests (criterion-based) but also have a separate system of trophies and titles that can be earned by winning tournaments (norm-based).Other common educational terms strongly associated with criterion testing are mastery learning, learning standards, competency-based education, and outcome-based education.As to the \"why\", these sorts of titles could appeal to people who see chess as more of a form of mental exercise for themselves than an opportunity to pwn noobs."

        "question": "Why is f4 by White so rarely seen against the Dutch?",
        "answer": "One of the more common responses to the Dutch Defense is as seen below:[FEN \"\"]\n1.d4 f5 2.c4 Nf6 3.Nc3I understand the logic behind this fairly well. White establishes a strong queenside presence and is free to bolster defenses in the center with their knight without fear of blocking their own pawns in. However, the following sequence of moves is almost never seen:[FEN \"\"]\n1.d4 f5 2.f4 Nf6 3.Nf3I understand why thisparticularversion is so rarely seen: the e5 square is given a needless amount of protection while leaving e4 defenseless. However, in general, you still never see players at the master level try to go for f4 and Nf3 against the Dutch, regardless of how the first few moves shake out. Why is this? I know anecdotally that it's good practice to put your pawns in front of your knights, but if that's the case, why do it only on the queenside and never on the kingside? In the first example up there, white usually plays Nf3 anyway, blocking their own pawn in. Why does this double standard exist?"

Nc2 a5 13. g3 O-O 14. Bg2One of the reasons of my preference is that I have control over the d5 square and black has a backward pawn on d6. Moreover, I can play moves like Qd3,a3, and play on the queenside with my rooks too.My issue with the Rossolimo is that it gives up the bishop pair for no obvious outpost for the knight like the second position in the open sicilian that I shared above.I would really appreciate it if you can tell me why the Rossolimo might offer better winning chances with White, and why top players are attracted to it, and why Black players try to avoid it in their repertoire.

        "answer": "I like going through open variations and taking notes and saving them in my database.However I have a problem. When I get to two of the exact same board positions and same color to play, if I got there via two different variations, any future variations I make and comment will be considered separate.For example, suppose I start a game with 1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Nf6 and add some variations with, e.g., 3.Nf3 and 3.Bc4 and make some comments.  Then, in the same database, I add a game with 1.Nc3 e5 2.e4 Nf6. This leads to exactly the same position but the variations and comments from the 1.e4 variation are not shown.How do I merge these variations or get SCID to understand that it's the same so it shows the variations after both move orders?  I don't want to write a whole new tree and branches just because I switched up one move.Or if anyone knows a different program I can use for this to save uncompleted games such as opening variations and I can write my notes that would be great."

Instead, Stockfish thinks 4...Bf5 is best, and if 5.Qb3 then 5...Qb6 and Black has completely equalized.My question, broadly, is when is Bf5 a good move for Black in the Slav, and when is it dangerous without a prior dxc4?  In my game, is part of the problem with 4...dxc4 that White has fianchettoed his bishop on g2, making it dangerous for Black to try to keep the pawn on c4 with 5...b5?"

Could be a \"Will they ever learn\" opening trap or a prearranged draw line. Anyone care to research it in a megabase?Note that just because Lichess lists 187\u00d710^6 e4 vs. 100\u00d710^6 d4 doesn't mean that an e4 game will be the winner! (By playing always the most often played move on the analysis board, I landed in the Lasker Pelikan Sveshnikov.)"

Black's king is temporarily unable to come to the 7th rank due to the white pawn and bishop combine. But can white win the g-pawn without letting go of his own pawn ?Thanks."

Perhaps I was using the wrong search terms.For context, I'm a beginner to chess, been playing for around a month.  I just went through the chess.com lesson on hanging and isolated pawn structures and there was one example they gave where they said something like, \"it might look like white is just sacrificing a pawn for no reason, but look closely and you'll see that this clears the h file, making way for white's rook to attack\".  Took me a few times of rewinding the video to understand the full attack on black'a defenses in that example, but it got me thinking about whether other types of unequal trades might actually be to my advantage at times, and, if so, when."

        "answer": "I have seen it suggested in various places (e.g., on Stack Overflowposts) that alpha-beta pruning cannot be \"naively\" parallelized. To me, an intuitive parallelization of alpha-beta withnthreads would be to assign each a thread to process the subtree defined by each child of the root node of the search tree. For example, in the tree below, if we hadn >= 3threads, we would assign one to process the left subtree (with root b), one to process the middle (root c) and one to process the right subtree (root d).I understand that we will not be able to pruneas manynodes with this approach, since sometimes pruning occurs based on the alpha-beta value of a previously processed subtree. However, won't we have the wait for the left subtree to finish being processed anyway if we run alpha-beta sequentially? By the time the sequential version knew it could prune part of the c and d subtrees, the parallel version will already be done processing them, right? While running alpha-beta on each subtree, we can still get the benefits of pruning for that subtree.Even if the number of children of the root is greater thann, the number of processors, why not just run alpha-beta on the leftmostnsubtrees and then use the results to define alpha and beta for  the nextnsubtrees until you have processed the whole tree?Perhaps this approach is so simple/trivial that no one discusses it, but I am confused why so many resources I have seen seem to suggest that parallelizing alpha-beta is extremely complicated or leads to worse performance."

Bg5 h6 11.Be3Here11...b6is the most popular response. My question is, why notNe8/Nfd7/Nh5, since those moves simultaneously deal with White's threat while making way for the f-pawn to be pushed? Initially, I thought the reason was because it'd be somehow bad for Black if White decided to capture onc5and Black had to capture back with the d-pawn. But consider this very similar line:[FEN \"\"]\n1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.Nf3 O-O 6.Be2 Nbd7 7.O-O e5 8.d5 Nc5 9.Qc2 a5 10.

        "question": "Overcoming severe time troubles",
        "answer": "I started playing chess 2 years ago and ever since I started, I have experienced consistent time troubles. Recently, I gathered some data from my 40 most recent rapid 10+0 games, and concluded that I am ~2.08 minutes behind my opponent at around the midpoint of the game.This is absolutely horrible ! In one game I was 6 minutes behind, compared to my opponent. While the best time advantage I have had is 1.3 minutes. Only in 4 of the 40 games I had a time advantage or equal time, so in conclusion,in ~90% of my games I am behind on clock of about ~2.1 minutes halfway through the game.As a result, I can't play blitz (3 minutes) at all, even though I wish I could, since I have to start pre-moving way before my opponent enters that stage of the game. Which further explains my rating discrepancy of 1700 in blitz while 1930 in rapid, on Chess.com...I think the main reason why I am so consistently behind on time stems frommy anxiety of missing a tacticor justblundering something. I really want to fix this problem, but it is just so hard. Has anyone experienced the same thing as me? How have you overcome this problem, and what are available resources for a player like me ?"
